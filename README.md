 The project started from scratch. The final result is a mini-car that can wireless remote through a smartphone by Bluetooth. On the other hand, it can also control through the internet with the information of hand pose from a webcam

## Task
[x] Create dataset script
[x] Build up assembly code for control motor and servo
[x] Build up mqtt-broker interface
[x] Build up system and implement the car
